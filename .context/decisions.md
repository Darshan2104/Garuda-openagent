# Durable decisions

## 2026-08-31 — external coding agents are runtimes, not models

Garuda will directly orchestrate ACP-compatible coding agents rather than place one agent loop behind Garuda's `Model` protocol. This prevents conflicting ownership of tools, permissions, retries, context, and session restoration.

## 2026-08-31 — use an ACP-first integration strategy

The first subscription lane uses user-installed, authenticated official CLIs or ACP adapters for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, Goose, and compatible agents. Direct transports are later work and require documented, supported public vendor APIs.

## 2026-08-31 — context uses committed durable files and generated handoffs

Architecture, decisions, discoveries, and conventions are committed. Current task and handoff state are generated per session, gitignored, and retained in the Garuda session store. One mutating session owns one workspace; parallel mutation uses separate worktrees.
